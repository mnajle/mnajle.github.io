I have added a new way of selecting the dates for the ranking. It now has a dates range selector that will allow to select any possible pair of start and end dates and its corresponding ranking!

Lets see more details on this new feature

* #### Pre-defined date ranges:
The four pre defined ranking that were previuosly available will continue to be visible but now they will also update the dates selector
